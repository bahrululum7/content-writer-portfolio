# 🧠 What is Web3?  
**Explained for Normies and Degens**

> tl;dr: Web1 = read, Web2 = read/write, Web3 = read/write/own

Web3 is not just a buzzword—it’s what happens when crypto bros, internet nerds, and freedom maxis team up to reinvent the internet.

Here’s the breakdown:

## 🌐 Web1 – The Static Internet (1990s–2005)
- You *read* stuff.
- Websites were like newspapers.
- No likes, no comments, just vibes.
- Yahoo was king.

## 🗨️ Web2 – The Social Internet (2005–now)
- You *read and write*.
- Social media took over. YouTube, Instagram, TikTok.
- But your data = their money.
- Facebook knows more about you than your mom.

## 🪙 Web3 – The Ownership Internet (now & future)
- You *read, write, and own*.
- Built on blockchain.
- You can own your assets (NFTs, tokens).
- Wallets = your new login.
- No middlemen, no banks, no Zuck.

## 🔥 Why Web3 matters:
- **True ownership**: That JPEG monkey? Yours.
- **Decentralized**: No one can ban your wallet.
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can build or participate.
- **Transparent**: On-chain is public. No shady stuff (unless it's an anon rug).

## 🤯 But also...
- Gas fees are pain.
- Wallets get hacked.
- UX is still trash sometimes.
- And scams? Lurking everywhere.

Still, Web3 is the playground for the bold. Whether you're here to build, trade, or just shitpost—welcome to the next internet.
