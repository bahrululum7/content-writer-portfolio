# 🎙️ Mock Brief: Tone Consistency — Educator, Degen, Shitposter

**Client (Simulation):** Podha Protocol  
**Goal:** Demonstrate a consistent and adaptable voice that blends three tones:  
- 🧠 Educator (insightful, clear)  
- 😎 Degen (relatable, crypto-native)  
- 😈 Shitposter (unfiltered, aggressive, humorous)

## 🔊 TONE 1: EDUCATOR

> Most DeFi platforms print rewards out of thin air.  
> Podha connects user deposits to real-world assets — like tokenized real estate and private credit.  
> Real work = real yield.  
>  
> No inflation games, no Ponzinomics.  
> Just productivity.  
> #CryptoEducation #RWA

## 🔊 TONE 2: DEGEN

> I used to farm 200% APR.  
> I also used to cry every Sunday night when it vanished.  
>  
> Now I stake RWAs. Yield isn’t sexy, but at least it’s not fake.  
> #DegenDiaries #YieldButReal

---

## 🔊 TONE 3: SHITPOSTER

> DeFi: “Stake this token to earn more of the same token that just dumped 93%.”  
>  
> Me: *cries in compound interest*  
>  
> Podha: “Here, earn yield from real assets.”  
>  
> Also me:  
> “wait that’s... legal?”
