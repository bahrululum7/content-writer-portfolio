# 🧵 How I Lost $10,000 in Crypto and Still Became Smarter

> A thread on lessons, pain, and why Ls are part of the game 🧵👇

1. I started trading shitcoins in 2021.
Didn’t know much.
Just vibes and green candles.
Made $2k in a week. Thought I was a genius.

---

2. Then I got greedy.
I aped into every Telegram group that screamed “100x gem”.
Didn’t read whitepapers.
Didn’t check liquidity.
Didn’t DYOR.

---

3. Rugged. Again. And again.

Every time I thought “This is the bottom”, it wasn’t.
Every time I thought “I learned my lesson”, I hadn’t.

---

4. I lost over $10,000.

But I gained something else:
- Respect for real builders
- Understanding of on-chain data
- Fearless curiosity about tech
- And... a healthy distrust of Discord DMs

---

5. The truth is: Crypto humbles you.

Everyone gets rekt.
Everyone learns the hard way.
The difference is whether you **leave** or **level up**.

---

6. If you're still here:
- Read protocols
- Learn on-chain tools (Dune, Etherscan)
- Build connections, not just bags
- Think long term

---

7. Crypto isn’t just about gains.

It’s about **open finance**, **digital ownership**, and being early to something big.

You’ll make mistakes. That’s fine.

Just don’t make the same ones twice.

Stay safe. Stay curious.  
We’re gonna make it (but only if you learn from Ls).
